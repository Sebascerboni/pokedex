# Pokedex an mobile app

Hi, this is a Pokedex mobile aplication. I consumed the **_Pokemon API_** to get all **First Generation Pokemons** that you will see on it.

I implement a login form with Firebase authentication service


## **How the login work?**

This is how the form looks like:

![login](https://github.com/Sebascerboni/pokedex/assets/90151064/e0d3f640-ba35-496c-a5a0-d71b45382bd1)

When you try to get into the app with incorrect credentials you will watch the same form but with a pop up error message like this:

![login_incorrecto](https://github.com/Sebascerboni/pokedex/assets/90151064/8717a38f-6ec6-4519-9257-c9b69865a340)

And when you get into the app will wath the home screen
