# Pokedex - a flutter app for Android

I am Sebasti√°n Cervantes and this an pokedex mobile aplication for android.

Below you can wathch how the login form works. For build it I used Firebase authentication service.


## The login looks like this:

![login](https://github.com/Sebascerboni/pokedex/assets/90151064/d558f1a1-47fc-49c8-a3ff-a8b6c46c52ed)

## When you try to log in with incorrect username or password then you will wath the next:
![login_incorrecto](https://github.com/Sebascerboni/pokedex/assets/90151064/a5e450e4-7649-4b8a-b95c-3dbb17d6772c)

## And finally when you log in with the correct credentials you will watch the home page:

![login_correcto](https://github.com/Sebascerboni/pokedex/assets/90151064/1d7e4baa-bd09-4e3d-a264-60c1479e573a)


For the aplication I work with the: **_Pokemon API_** to access to the information of all **_First Generation Pokemons_**. Enjoy it
